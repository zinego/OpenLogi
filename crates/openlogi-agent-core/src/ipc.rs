//! tarpc service contract between the GUI (client) and the agent (server).
//!
//! tarpc generates the `AgentClient` and the `serve` glue from this trait. tarpc
//! is strict request/response — no server push — so the streaming needs become
//! polling: the GUI polls [`Agent::snapshot`] on a timer, and the Add Device
//! flow long-polls [`Agent::next_pairing`], which the agent holds open until a
//! pairing event arrives or the request deadline elapses.
