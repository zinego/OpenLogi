//! Headless orchestration shared by the OpenLogi background agent and
//! (transitionally) the GUI.
//!
//! Everything here is GUI-free: the CGEventTap hook runtime, background HID++
//! writes, DPI-cycle state, and binding-map construction. It was extracted from
//! `openlogi-gui` so the always-on agent process can own the input/device path
//! without linking gpui.
