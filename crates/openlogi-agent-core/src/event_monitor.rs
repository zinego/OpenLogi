//! Live event monitor: a shared, bounded buffer that mirrors the events the OS
//! mouse hook observes to the GUI's debug monitor, on demand.
//!
//! Monitoring is **off by default**. The freeze-sensitive hook callback pays
//! only a single relaxed atomic load per event while off (see the freeze-hazard
//! note in `openlogi-hook`); once the GUI starts polling it attempts one
//! non-blocking buffer write and drops the monitor event on contention. The GUI
//! enables monitoring implicitly by polling
//! [`EventMonitor::poll`], and [`EventMonitor::run_idle_janitor`] turns it back
//! off when polls stop — so a closed panel or a crashed GUI can't leave the
//! callback doing buffer work forever.
